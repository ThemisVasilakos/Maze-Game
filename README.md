# Maze Game
IMPORTANT!!
NCURSES must be installed to compile the files.For debian based systems just give the following command:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
Then compile: g++ *.cpp -o game -lncurses
At the end run it with:./game map.txt score.bin
P.S you can use any map you like.Just modify a txt with '*' for walls
